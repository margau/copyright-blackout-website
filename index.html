        <br>There were many platforms about all topics and interests you can imagine.
        <br>Back then, the internet was really a diverse place with a variety of platforms.</h2>

        <p class="appeal">You have the chance to keep this freedom!</p>
        <p>To protest against the planned EU copyright directive,
          which would have an large impact at nearly all, especially the small, internet platforms,
          <b>we will simulate how the internet could look if the directive passes the EU-parliament.</b></p>
          <p class="minappeal">Many platforms, including the german Wikipedia, will <b>turn dark on March 21!</b></p>
          <h3>What's the problem?</h3>
          <p>With article 13 and other parts of the directive, small and medium-sized plattforms will be forced to implement uploadfilters or similar.
            For much platforms and boards, this is beyond their capabilities, and their existence is in danger!</p>
          <h3>What to do against it?</h3>
